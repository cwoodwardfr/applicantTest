# applicantTest
Simple app ... but far from optimal.

This repository contains the same program in Java and in .Net. It is purposefully suboptimal. The goal is for the applicant to spend about 1 hour to improve the code and explain what they did and how it improves the program.

## Getting started
- Clone this repository
- Choose if you work with Java or .Net
- Open the corresponding project
- Insert the unique URL that was provided to you (look for <YOU MUST CHANGE THIS> in the code)
- Compile and run the code

You're ready to start the test. Now it's up to you to improve the code.
